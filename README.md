# Data Structures and Algorithms

See [setup instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/code-301/3-code-challenges), in the Code 301 Setup Guide.

## Repository Quick Tour and Usage

### 301 Code Challenges

Under the `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository, at the top level is a folder called `code-challenges`

Each day, you'll add one new file to this folder to do your work for the day's assigned code challenge

### 401 Data Structures, Code Challenges

# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
This function take any list of items, and return the reverse of it.

## Approach & Efficiency
 for the chellenge it was normal but for the test I havn't made it as the first time making test until the instructor explain how to, so it's normal now also

## Solution

# Shift an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
This function take any list and value, and return the list with the value in the middle of it.

## Approach & Efficiency
 I check for length of the list to determine the index i will insert the value in, it takes me 1 hour 

## Solution

# Array Binary Search
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key.return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
 1 : create the function with two arguments

2 : create a result by default equal to -1 and counter =0

3 : loop through the list and counter will increment 1 each time

4 : if the key inserted was zero ill return the first item and break the loop

5 : if key is bigger than zero ill continuo loop until counter reach the value of key minus one and ill break and return the item

it take me two hours
