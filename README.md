See [setup instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/code-301/3-code-challenges), in the Code 301 Setup Guide.

## Repository Quick Tour and Usage

### 301 Code Challenges

Under the `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository, at the top level is a folder called `code-challenges`

Each day, you'll add one new file to this folder to do your work for the day's assigned code challenge

### 401 Data Structures, Code Challenges

# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
This function take any list of items, and return the reverse of it.

## Approach & Efficiency
 for the chellenge it was normal but for the test I havn't made it as the first time making test until the instructor explain how to, so it's normal now also

## Solution

# Shift an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
This function take any list and value, and return the list with the value in the middle of it.

## Approach & Efficiency
 I check for length of the list to determine the index i will insert the value in, it takes me 1 hour 

## Solution

# Array Binary Search
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key.return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
 1 : create the function with two arguments

2 : create a result by default equal to -1 and counter =0

3 : loop through the list and counter will increment 1 each time

4 : if the key inserted was zero ill return the first item and break the loop

5 : if key is bigger than zero ill continuo loop until counter reach the value of key minus one and ill break and return the item

it take me two hours

# Linked Lists
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Write a clsses and some methods to create linked list and to test them

## Approach & Efficiency
 1 : create the Node class and the constructor method for it.

2 : create the Linked list class and the constructor methos, the insert method, the inclde method, and finally the str method

3 : in constructor method I set the head to none, and in the insert method
    3:a I add a new node with the value argument
    3:b if there are a head we will set our current pointer to the head
    3:c i'll loop while there are following node to the current node 
    3:d when I finish I'll assign new node value as the next value for the head
    3:e if there are no head and one value entered we will set it as the head

4 : in the include method ill loop in the values of the linked list and check each one

5 : in the str method ill loop also iin the linked list and store each item on pre built empty string variable and return the result string

it take me three hours

## API

- The constructor method, to assign the head.value
- The insert method to insert a new node at the begining of linked lists
- the include method to check if a given value is included at the linked list
- str method to return result as readable string
