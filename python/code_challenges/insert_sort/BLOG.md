# insert sort algorithms

*`We have this list [5,4,30,27]`*

```
step1:

[4, 5, 30, 27]

{'when j is 1': 'min is 1', 'when j is 2': 'min is 1', 'when j is 3': 'min is 1'}```

step2:

[4, 5, 30, 27]

{'when j is 2': 'min is 1', 'when j is 3': 'min is 1'}

step3:

[4, 5, 27, 30]

{ 'when j is 3': 'min is 3'}

step4:


[4, 5, 27, 30]

{'when j is 3': 'min is 3'}
